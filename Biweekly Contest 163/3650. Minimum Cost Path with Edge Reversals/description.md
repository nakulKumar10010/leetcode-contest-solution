## ðŸŽ¯ Catch of the Question

The graph is **not a standard undirected weighted graph**.  

Instead, the edges are **directional with different costs**:

- Going from **u â†’ v** costs `wt`.  
- But going **backward (v â†’ u)** costs `2 * wt`.  

This **asymmetry** is the catch.  
Normally, in undirected graphs, both directions have the same weight.  
Here, the backward direction is intentionally penalized with a doubled cost.  

Thatâ€™s why during graph construction:

```cpp
adj[u].push_back({v, wt});      // forward with normal weight
adj[v].push_back({u, 2 * wt});  // backward with doubled weight
```
And thatâ€™s why you need Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm (not BFS), because edge weights are not uniform.

## âœ… So the catch is:

You must correctly model the graph with different costs depending on the direction of traversal, otherwise the shortest path result will be wrong.
